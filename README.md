# ğŸš¨ False Alarm Detection System using Machine Learning

This project is a Streamlit-based web app that predicts whether a detected alarm is a **true danger** or a **false alarm** based on historical sensor data. It uses a **Logistic Regression model** trained on real-world features like temperature, humidity, Hâ‚‚S content, and more.
